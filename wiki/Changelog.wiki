*2010-07-02:*
 * Linux and maemo5 now uses a telepathy observer component to listen for incoming calls. When there is an incoming call from the GV number, it will understand that this call is because of our dialing through GV. The intended result was to auto-accept the call. For the moment, it will just automatically dismiss the dialog box that allows the user to cancel the call.
 * Cached the numbers registered with GV

*Up to 2010-07-02:*

Tested in Windows, Linux, and maemo5
 * Standard dialer (a bit incomplete)
 * GV contacts list, settings, history inbox
 * Dial any number from dialer, dial/sms contact from contact list, dial.sms contact from history list
 * Download and play voicemail
 * Cache contacts, settings and voicemail so that network traffic is reduced
 * Single instance of the application per user
 * Linux and Windows (actually any OS that supports system trays) will show a system tray.
