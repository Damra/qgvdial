#summary Change log

*2010-08-28*
 * Revamped the entire UI.
 * Auto-rotation
 * Initial support for QT CSS

*2010-08-14:*
 * Inbox how uses data API instead of screen scraping the website.
 * Calls, sms and voicemail all work from the Inbox page.
 * Contacts and Inbox page use the same interface to make calls and send texts.

*2010-08-07:*
 * Provided a dbus listening service so that fcrochik's MyContacts can call out using that.
 * Contacts using Google Contacts Data API. Additions, modifications and deletions all taken care of.
 * Callbacks now work once again.

*2010-08-04:*
 * Dial out directly works for telepathy CM: ring and spirit. sofiasip also works, but the GV announcer says that the call could not be completed.
 * Dial out works is desktop skype: Windows and Linux
 * Two different deb files for n900: One for old mobility and one for the new version
 * Contacts now use the Google contacts API. This means lesser data to process on contacts refresh.

*2010-07-19:*
 * Desktop Skype integration: If you have a Skype subscription and you use it as a callback phone with GV, then qgvdial will attempt to recognize this and behave just like the phone version: Dismiss the cancel window.

*2010-07-16:*
 * Dial out using POST. Much faster.

*2010-07-02:*
 * Linux and maemo5 now uses a telepathy observer component to listen for incoming calls. When there is an incoming call from the GV number, it will understand that this call is because of our dialing through GV. The intended result was to auto-accept the call. For the moment, it will just automatically dismiss the dialog box that allows the user to cancel the call.
 * Cached the numbers registered with GV

*Up to 2010-07-02:*

Tested in Windows, Linux, and maemo5
 * Standard dialer (a bit incomplete)
 * GV contacts list, settings, history inbox
 * Dial any number from dialer, dial/sms contact from contact list, dial.sms contact from history list
 * Download and play voicemail
 * Cache contacts, settings and voicemail so that network traffic is reduced
 * Single instance of the application per user
 * Linux and Windows (actually any OS that supports system trays) will show a system tray.
